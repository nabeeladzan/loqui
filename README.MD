# Voice chat on Python
Simple voice chat on Python Twisted with the help of PyAudio module.

###### Python on Papyrus Youtube channel

Tips if you want to expand the project in the future:
1) Split up the UI and the Twisted Client
2) Create the server to find other clients, 
do not write the pure address as I did it here.
3) Just do it.
